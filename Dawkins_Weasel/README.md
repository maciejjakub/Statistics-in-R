# Dawkin's weasel
R language approach to Dawkin's weasel program, which aim is to simulate evolutionary systems. You can read more about it on Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program

## How it works?
It starts with creation of random string, then makes n copies of that string, which is specified by the user. Afterwards changes each character in each string with 5% probability, compares them to specified string using score value and chooses one with the highest. Process is repeated n times, specified by the user. Works with "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL" as well as with other strings.
